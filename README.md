# Rock-Paper-Scissors API

A simple two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game where a player competes against another user using API-driven logic.

## Features

- API-driven gameplay logic.
- No player names; only 'player' placeholders are used.

## How It Works

1. The player selects **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The API determines the choice of the opposing user (`user2`).
3. The winner is determined based on the classic RPS rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beat Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
4. The result is displayed after each round.
